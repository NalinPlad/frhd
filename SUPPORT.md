## Reporting a Bug

If you find an issue, report an issue! When you *do* file an issue, expect a response in two to three business days. 
Versions < 2.x are currently being phased out, so if you find an issue I probably will not fix them. I will be able to fix
small issue, but with any substantial problems my advice is to upgrade. Thanks!
